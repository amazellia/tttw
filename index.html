	<h1 id="Mathematics"><a href="mathematics.xml">Mathematics</a></h1>
	<p>
	Responding to the demand for graduates with quantitative and analytical skills, the Mathematics area prepares students and researchers 
	to be visionary thinkers, exploring tomorrow’s big challenges today. established an enviable reputation for our teaching and research 
	standards largely due to our high-calibre staff (Source: <a href="https://www.newcastle.edu.au/">University of Newcastle</a>). Our courses
	includes Discrete Mathematics, Foundational Studies in Mathematics, and Thinking and Working Mathematically.
	</p>
	<h2>
		<a href="https://www.newcastle.edu.au/course/MATH1520">MATH1520</a>
		Discrete Mathematic
	</h2>
	<p>
	Discrete mathematics is the study of mathematical structures that are discrete, separated or distinct; in contrast with calculus 
	which deals with continuous change. It is an important area of pure and applied mathematics, as well as providing the mathematical 
	basis for the understanding of computers and modern computation. Discrete Mathematics is important in the sciences, where it has 
	increasing application in many areas, an exemplar of which is the understanding of DNA sequences in molecular biology. The Discrete 
	Mathematics course introduces first year students to the basic concepts of discrete mathematics, covering topics such as sets, logic, 
	enumeration methods, probability, recurrence relations, induction and graph theory. The course provides important background for 
	students pursuing a BMath degree. It covers much of the mathematics essential for students majoring in Computer Science or Software 
	Engineering, and is a compulsory course in those degree programs.

		Foundational Studies in Mathematics
	</h2>
	<p>
	Many relationships in the real world can be modelled via a mathematical function of one or more variables. This course introduces 
	common functions of one variable used in the sciences, equips students with the tools of differential and integral calculus to analyse 
	the properties of such functions, and develops an understanding of the role of functions and calculus in real-world systems.
	This course is suitable for students with a background in high-school mathematics who have not studied, or who have not succeeded 
	in, 2 unit or higher mathematics courses at HSC level.

		Thinking and Working Mathematically
	</h2>
	<p>
	Provides students in Education programs with an insight into the nature of problem-solving in mathematics. In particular, within the 
	scope of the mathematics they have studied, the students will become aware of the process of using mathematics in open-ended problems, 
	the way in which new mathematics can be developed, and mathematics as a human endeavour. Encourages students to think mathematically 
	and increase students' confidence in their mathematical ability.
